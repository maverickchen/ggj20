Project created for GLobal Game Jam 2020.

<Leave it to Beavers>
  
Background: Beavers create dams as a protection against predators, and to provide easy access to food during winter. Beavers are prolific builders, and they can repair their dams overnight. Because of this, destroying a beaver dam without removing the beavers is difficult.

Here, a zookeeper tries to keep beavers active by intentionally destroying their dam, because in such a domesticated environment, beavers don't move around much which can lead to health issues. Meanwhile the beavers, threatened from getting their habitat destroyed, work constantly to repair their home.

Gameplay Description:

Two to four players game, where first one to join is a Zookeeper, and the rest are the Beavers. It's the Zookeeper versus the Beavers. As a beaver, your job is to build a dam with the branches that keep falling from the tree. Placing the branches on the blinking square zone on the creek will build the dam. As a Zookeeper, your job is to destroy the dam and put the branches in the trash can. A Zookeeper is tired so he moves slower than the beavers, especially when he's carrying the branches. A Zookeeper can pick up two branches at a time. The Beavers win if they finish building the dam. The Zookeeper wins once he completely destroys the dam.
